      <h1>Dynamic Timeline Theory</h1>
      <p>
        The Dynamic Timeline Theory suggests that the past, present, and future are fluid. When someone travels back in time, they can influence events and potentially change the future. This means history is not fixed — it can be rewritten based on new actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this theory, each change made in the past creates a ripple effect that alters the timeline moving forward. It introduces the concept of branching paths, where decisions reshape outcomes, sometimes drastically.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this theory allows for greater agency and unpredictability, it also raises complex questions about paradoxes — such as the classic "grandfather paradox" — where changing one event may erase the conditions that caused the change in the first place.
