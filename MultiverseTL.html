      <h1>Multiverse Timeline Theory</h1>
      <p>
        The Multiverse Timeline Theory proposes that every decision or random event creates a new universe. Instead of altering a single timeline, time travel opens pathways to entirely new realities, each with its own version of events.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to this model, countless parallel universes exist, each representing different possibilities. In one universe, you might have chosen a different career; in another, historical events unfolded differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        This theory removes the danger of paradoxes, since actions in one universe don’t alter another. It also introduces exciting but challenging ideas about identity, consequence, and which version of reality is “real.”
