      <h1>Fixed Timeline Theory</h1>
      <p>
        The Fixed Timeline Theory suggests that all events in time are predetermined. In this model, every cause has a known effect, and even time travel cannot alter the course of events. If someone travels back in time, their actions were already part of history.

        This theory implies that free will is an illusion. All decisions, large or small, are outcomes of prior conditions. From a philosophical standpoint, the fixed timeline offers a deterministic view of the universe—everything unfolds according to an unchangeable script.

      <p>
        Scientists and theorists often compare this to a film reel: the beginning, middle, and end are already recorded. If you jump to any part of the reel, the content does not change; it only plays what's already there.
